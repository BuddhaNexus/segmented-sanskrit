The files in these folder are double. 
On GRETIL sometimes the same file is presented in several formats like html, txt, 
as index files with all lines sorted (iu) or with pada markers (au)
For BuddhaNexus such double files will give wrong results as they are basically the same.

Files of the same texts with different transliterations are not in this folder but are kept with the other valid xml files.
